<div><p>In numerical linear algebra, a well-established practice is to choose a norm that exploits the structure of the problem at hand to optimise accuracy or computational complexity. In numerical polynomial algebra, a single norm (attributed to Weyl) dominates the literature. This article initiates the use of 𝐿 𝑝 norms for numerical algebraic geometry, with an emphasis on 𝐿 ∞ . This classical idea yields strong improvements in the analysis of the number of steps performed by numerous iterative algorithms. In particular, we exhibit three algorithms where, despite the complexity of computing 𝐿 ∞ -norm, the use of 𝐿 𝑝 -norms substantially reduces computational complexity: a subdivision-based algorithm in real algebraic geometry for computing the homology of semialgebraic sets, a wellknown meshing algorithm in computational geometry and the computation of zeros of systems of complex quadratic polynomials (a particular case of Smale's 17th problem).</p></div>

<div><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In numerical analysis, it matters how we measure errors. Change the metric we measure the perturbations with, and a well-conditioned input may turn badly conditioned (a remarkable example is in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). Because of this, a careful choice of how we measure errors is a fundamental step in the design and analysis of algorithms. A main example is numerical linear algebra, where it is commonplace to carefully choose a matrix norm depending on the problem at hand: the goal is to exploit the structure of the problem and optimise computational efficiency.</p><p>Unlike numerical linear algebra, a single norm -the Weyl norm -prevails in numerical algebraic geometry. The nice properties of the Weyl norm, ease of computing and unitary invariance, explain this prevalence. Nevertheless, the absence of complexity analyses using other norms in numerical algebraic geometry reflects badly on the theoretical strength of our analyses, which appear to rely on a specific choice of metric.</p><p>In this paper, we aim to show that using other norms is possible in numerical algebraic geometry. To do so, we consider an 𝐿 ∞ -norm in the space of polynomial systems and show how this leads to numerical algorithms and a complexity framework analogous to the one we have with the Weyl norm. Furthermore, we show that the change of norms leads to significant improvements in complexity bounds thanks to the better probabilistic behaviour of this 𝐿 ∞ norm with respect to the Weyl norm. We show this in three relevant cases: 1) computation of the homology of algebraic sets, 2) the Plantinga-Vegter algorithm and 3) the homotopy continuation method for quadratic polynomial systems.</p><p>We now discuss in more detail the aspects we have mentioned in passing to put our results in context within the wider setting of complexity theory for numerical algorithms and numerical algebraic geometry.</p><p>Complexity paradigm. The behaviour of numerical algorithms varies from input to input. This phenomenon is due not necessarily to the algorithms themselves but rather to the numerical sensitivityhow much the output varies with respect to a perturbation of the input -of the input we are processing. The numerical sensitivity of an input is captured by the so-called condition number. Then, in turn, condition numbers allow one to analyse numerical algorithms and explain why numerical algorithms handle some inputs faster than others.</p><p>Central to our paper is the fact that the choice of the metric under which we measure perturbations determines the condition number of the data. An example of this is given by the polynomial 𝑋 𝑑 -1, which is well-conditioned (for the zero finding problem) with respect to the standard norm in equation (2.2) but badly conditioned with respect to the Weyl norm in equation <ref type="bibr">(2.3)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">Example 14.3]</ref>.</p><p>A drawback of condition-based complexity analyses is that, as we don't know a priori the condition of the input at hand, we cannot foresee the running time for this input. We can nonetheless get an idea of how the algorithm behaves in general by randomising the input. This allows one to obtain probabilistic estimates for the practical performance of the numerical algorithm.</p><p>Let F be either R or C. Let also 𝑛, 𝑑 ∈ N, 𝑛, 𝑑 ≥ 1. We denote by H F 𝑑 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> the linear space of homogeneous polynomials of degree d in the 𝑛 + 1 variables 𝑋 0 , 𝑋 1 , . . . , 𝑋 𝑛 with coefficients in F. Let 𝒅 = (𝑑 1 , . . . , 𝑑 𝑞 ) ∈ N 𝑞 and 𝑛 ∈ N as above. We denote by H F 𝒅 <ref type="bibr">[𝑞]</ref> the space <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. If F is clear from the context, or if it is not relevant to the argument, we will omit the superscript. We will use the following conventions for dimension counting: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and 𝑁 :=</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H F 𝑑 1 [1] × • • • × H F 𝑑 𝑞</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑁 𝑖 := 𝑛 + 𝑑 𝑖 𝑑 𝑖 = dim F H F 𝑑 𝑖</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝑞 𝑖=1 𝑛 + 𝑑 𝑖 𝑑 𝑖 = dim F H F 𝒅 [𝑞].</formula><p>We also use D := max{𝑑 1 , . . . , 𝑑 𝑞 } and denote by Δ the 𝑞 × 𝑞 diagonal matrix with 𝑑 𝑖 in its ith diagonal entry. In all that follows, S 𝑛 := {𝑥 ∈ R 𝑛+1 | 𝑥 2 = 1} will be the (real) n-sphere and P 𝑛 := C 𝑛+1 /C * the complex projective space of dimension n. We note that there will be no ambiguity, as the sphere is the usual space to work with real polynomials and the projective space is the usual one for complex polynomials.</p></div>
<div><head>Remark 2.1.</head><p>In what follows, we will write 𝑧 ∈ P 𝑛 instead of [𝑧] ∈ P 𝑛 , and we will assume that the representative 𝑧 ∈ C 𝑛+1 always satisfies 𝑧 2 = 1. This simplifies the form of many of our definitions. This convention can be made without loss of generality as every point in P 𝑛 has a representative of norm 1.</p></div>
<div><head n="2.1.">Euclidean norms</head><p>The simplest norm considered on H R 𝒅 <ref type="bibr">[𝑞]</ref> is the one induced by the standard Euclidean inner product in a monomial basis. Every 𝑓 ∈ H F 𝑑 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> can be uniquely represented as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝑓 = | 𝛼 |=𝑑 𝑓 𝛼 𝑋 𝛼 , (<label>2.1)</label></formula><p>where 𝛼 = (𝛼 0 , . . . , 𝛼 𝑛 ) ∈ N 𝑛+1 and |𝛼| = 𝛼 0 + • • • + 𝛼 𝑛 . The norm induced by the standard Euclidean inner product is therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝑓 std := | 𝛼 |=𝑑 | 𝑓 𝛼 | 2 .</formula><p>(2.2)</p><p>For 𝑓 = ( 𝑓 1 , . . . , 𝑓 𝑞 ) ∈ H 𝒅 <ref type="bibr">[𝑞]</ref>, the norm extends as 𝑓 2 std := 𝑓 1 2 std + • • • + 𝑓 𝑞 2 std . The most commonly used norm on H 𝒅 <ref type="bibr">[𝑞]</ref> is the Weyl norm. For a polynomial as in equation <ref type="bibr">(2.1)</ref>, this is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">𝑓 𝑊 := | 𝛼 |=𝑑 𝑑 𝛼 -1 | 𝑓 𝛼 | 2 , (<label>2.3)</label></formula><p>where 𝑑 𝛼 is the multinomial coefficient 𝑑! 𝛼 0 !...𝛼 𝑛 ! . Again, for 𝑓 ∈ H 𝒅 <ref type="bibr">[𝑞]</ref>, this extends by 𝑓 2 𝑊 := 𝑓 1 2</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">𝑊 + • • • + 𝑓 𝑞 2 𝑊 .</formula><p>The Weyl norm is also induced by an inner product, and this inner product is invariant under the action of the unitary group (respectively, the orthogonal group when the underlying field is R). It is straightforward to check that, for 𝑓 ∈ H 𝒅 <ref type="bibr">[𝑞]</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">𝑓 𝑊 ≤ 𝑓 std ≤ max 𝑖 ≤𝑞 max | 𝛼 |=𝑑 𝑖 𝑑 𝑖 𝛼 𝑓 𝑊 .</formula><p>Here, and in all that follows, for any 𝑥 ∈ S 𝑛 and 𝑓 ∈ H 𝒅 <ref type="bibr">[𝑞]</ref>, D 𝑥 𝑓 : T 𝑥 S 𝑛 → R 𝑞 is the derivative of f at x restricted to the tangent space T 𝑥 S 𝑛 of S 𝑛 at x. A similar convention applies in the complex case replacing S 𝑛 and T 𝑥 S 𝑛 by P 𝑛 and T 𝑧 P 𝑛 . The following property (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">Proposition 16.16]</ref>) is one of the most important properties of the Weyl norm from the viewpoint of the complexity of numerical algorithms.</p><p>Proposition 2.2. For all 𝑥 ∈ S 𝑛 , the map</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">H 𝒅 [𝑞] 𝑓 ↦ → ev 𝑥 𝑓 := 𝑓 (𝑥), Δ -1 2 D 𝑥 𝑓</formula><p>is an orthogonal projection from H 𝒅 <ref type="bibr">[𝑞]</ref> endowed with the Weyl norm onto R 𝑞 × T 𝑥 S 𝑛 R 𝑞+𝑛 equipped with the standard Euclidean norm. An analogous statement holds in the complex case.</p></div>
<div><head n="2.2.">Functional norms</head><p>We will consider functional norms that arise from evaluating polynomials at points on the sphere. One might consider other norms (as we do in Section A), but 𝐿 𝑝 -norms suffice for obtaining the computational improvements we aim for. Although in the sequel we will only use the 𝐿 ∞ -norm, we present the full family of 𝐿 𝑝 -norms since we consider that these norms will be useful in the future. Moreover, presenting the full family of 𝐿 𝑝 -norms allows us to appreciate how the 𝐿 ∞ differs from and relates to these other norms. We will consider the two following classes of L-norms on H 𝒅 <ref type="bibr">[𝑞]</ref>:</p><p>(R) Real 𝐿 𝑝 -norm:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">For 𝑝 ∈ [1, ∞], 𝑓 R 𝑝 := ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ max 𝑥 ∈S 𝑛 𝑓 (𝑥) ∞ = max 𝑥 ∈S 𝑛 max 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥)| if 𝑝 = ∞ E 𝔵 ∈S 𝑛 𝑓 (𝔵) 𝑝 𝑝 1/ 𝑝 = E 𝔵 ∈S 𝑛 𝑞 𝑖=1 | 𝑓 𝑖 (𝔵)| 𝑝 1/ 𝑝 otherwise,</formula><p>where the expectations are taken over the uniform distribution of the n-dimensional sphere S 𝑛 ⊆ R 𝑛+1 .</p><p>https://doi.org/10.1017/fms.2022.89 Published online by Cambridge University Press (C) Complex 𝐿 𝑝 -norm: For 𝑝 ∈ <ref type="bibr">[1, ∞]</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">𝑓 C 𝑝 := ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ max 𝑧 ∈P 𝑛 𝑓 (𝑧) ∞ = max 𝑧 ∈P 𝑛 max 𝑖 | 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑧)| if 𝑝 = ∞ E 𝔷 ∈P 𝑛 𝑓 (𝔷) 𝑝 𝑝 1/ 𝑝 = E 𝔷 ∈P 𝑛 𝑞 𝑖=1 | 𝑓 𝑖 (𝔷)| 𝑝 1/ 𝑝 otherwise,</formula><p>where the expectations are taken over the uniform distribution of the complex n-dimensional projective space P 𝑛 := P 𝑛 C .

(I) We have actions of the qth power of the (real) orthogonal group, 𝒪(𝑛 + 1) 𝑞 , on H R 𝒅 <ref type="bibr">[𝑞]</ref>, given by ( 𝐴, 𝑓 ) ↦ → ( 𝑓 𝐴 𝑖 𝑖 ) := ( 𝑓 𝑖 ( 𝐴 𝑖 𝑋)). Similarly, we have an action of the qth power of the unitary group, 𝒰(𝑛 + 1) 𝑞 , on H C 𝒅 <ref type="bibr">[𝑞]</ref>. The norms R 𝑝 and</p></div>
<div><head>C</head><p>𝑝 are invariant under these actions. We perform some simple computations to have a better grasp of the introduced norms.</p><p>Example 2.4 (Monomials). We consider the value of the norms for a monomial 𝑋 𝛼 ∈ H 𝑑 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> of degree d. In this case, we have that for 𝑝 ∈ [1, ∞),</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">𝑋 𝛼 R 𝑝 = Γ 𝑛+1 2 𝑛 𝑖=0 Γ 𝑝 𝛼 𝑖 +1 2 𝜋 𝑛+1 2 Γ 𝑝𝑑+𝑛+1 2 1 𝑝</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">𝑋 𝛼 C 𝑝 = 𝑛! 𝑛 𝑖=0 Γ 𝑝 𝛼 𝑖 2 + 1 Γ 𝑝𝑑 2 + 𝑛 + 1 1 𝑝</formula><p>, where Γ is Euler's Gamma function, and that</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">𝑋 𝛼 R ∞ = 𝑋 𝛼 C ∞ = 𝑛 𝑖=0 𝛼 𝑖 𝑑 𝛼 𝑖 2 = 1 𝑑 𝑑 𝑛 𝑖=0 𝛼 𝛼 𝑖 𝑖 .</formula><p>For the calculations of 𝐿 𝑝 -norms of monomials, we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Although the calculation is only illustrated over the reals in the reference, the complex case is similar. For the second one, note that for monomials, real and complex ∞-norms are equivalent. Once this is clear, we are just using the method of Lagrange multipliers to compute the maximum over the sphere.</p><p>1Observe, however, that R 𝑝 are also norms for H C 𝒅 [𝑞] since a complex homogeneous polynomial cannot vanish on the real sphere without being zero.</p></div>
<div><head>Example 2.5 (Linear functions)</head><p>. Let 1 = (1, 1, . . . , 1) ∈ N 𝑞 and 𝑓 ∈ H 1 <ref type="bibr">[𝑞]</ref>. Then f can be identified with a matrix A of size 𝑞 × (𝑛 + 1). We can see that</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">𝑓 ∞ = 𝐴 2,∞ := sup 𝑥≠0 𝐴𝑥 ∞ 𝑥 2 ,</formula><p>where 2,∞ is the operator norm, where the domain vector space has the usual Euclidean norm 2 and the codomain the ∞-norm ∞ .  <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. As this function is constant on the real sphere, we have that for all 𝑝 ∈ [1, ∞],</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">For 𝑝 ∈ [1, ∞), 𝑓 R 𝑝 = 𝑋 0 R 𝑝 𝐴 1 2 , . . . ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">𝑓 R 𝑝 = 1.</formula><p>However, on P 𝑛 , f does not behave as a constant function as it has a positive dimensional zero set. Again, arguing as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, we can conclude that</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">𝑓 C 𝑝 = 1 𝜋 𝑛+1 𝑛! (𝑛 + 𝑝)! ∫ 𝑧 ∈C 𝑛+1 | 𝑓 (𝑧)| 𝑝 e -|𝑧 | 2 1 𝑝</formula><p>for 𝑝 ∈ [1, ∞). Now, if p is even, we can obtain the expression</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">𝑓 C 𝑝 = 𝑛 + 2 2 -1 𝛼∈N 𝑛+1 | 𝛼 |= 𝑝/2 𝑝/2 𝛼 2 𝑝 2𝛼 -1 1 𝑝 after writing | 𝑓 (𝑧)| 𝑝 = 𝑓 (𝑧) 𝑝 2 𝑓 (𝑧)</formula><p>𝑝 2 , expanding and using separation of variables. In particular, for 𝑝 = 2, we obtain that</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">𝑓 C 2 = 2 𝑛 + 2 ≠ 1.</formula><p>This shows how the norms C 𝑝 may be smaller than their corresponding norm R 𝑝 for 𝑝 ∈ [1, ∞).

This shows that for degrees 𝑑 ≥ 3, the norms R ∞ and C ∞ disagree on real polynomials.</formula><p>The following proposition lists simple inequalities between the functional norms.

The only properties of the real condition number 𝜅 that are used in the complexity analyses are those stated in Theorem 3.2: the regularity inequality, the 1st and 2nd Lipschitz properties and the higher derivative estimate. As these properties hold as well for K, an almost identical condition-based cost analysis can be derived when we pass from the Weyl norm to the real 𝐿 ∞ -norm and from 𝜅 to K. We showcase this in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2.</p><p>2. When we consider random input models, the gains in the complexity estimates become more evident. In Section 4.3, we show that the ratio of the new K to 𝜅 is typically of the order of √ 𝑛/ √ 𝑁 for a random polynomial system. Since 𝑁 ∼ 𝑛 𝑑 for 𝑛 &gt; 𝑑 and 𝑁 ∼ 𝑑 𝑛 for 𝑑 &gt; 𝑛, this yields a significant reduction in the complexity estimates. 3. Computing the Weyl norm is cheaper than computing the real 𝐿 ∞ -norm, but this does not affect the overall complexity: We only compute the 𝐿 ∞ -norm once, and the cost of this computation is dominated by that of the remaining steps.</p><p>In what follows, we will focus on algorithms dealing with real algebraic sets. The algorithms we have in mind are the ones in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> and the Plantinga-Vegter algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> as described and analysed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> (compare to <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>). Our condition number K as defined in the preceding section will improve the overall computational complexity of these algorithms. Similar results can be obtained for the algorithms dealing with semialgebraic sets in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> (compare to <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>) using natural extensions K and K * of the condition numbers 𝜅 and 𝜅 * used in these papers.</p></div>
<div><head n="4.1.">A grid-based algorithm and its condition-based complexity</head><p>A grid-based algorithm is a subdivision-based method that constructs a grid to discretise the original problem and solves the latter by working on the grid points only (selecting and finding proximity relations between its points).

Their basic structure is (simplifying to the extreme) the following:</p><p>1. Estimate the condition number of the problem (with a sequence of grids of increasing fineness). 2. Create an extra grid (if necessary) whose mesh is determined by the condition number. 3. Select points in the grid, and use them to obtain a solution to the problem.</p><p>In general, grid-based algorithms have complexity Ω(D 𝑛 ). This fact allows us to estimate the norm 𝑓 R ∞ of the data f without affecting the overall complexity of the algorithms. Moreover, the fact that K is smaller than 𝜅 results in a cost reduction.</p><p>In this subsection, we focus on an algorithm for the computation of the Betti numbers of a spherical algebraic set. This covers the case of counting zeros of a square polynomial system treated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> and the computation of the Betti numbers of a projective real variety <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. For simplicity of exposition, we omit some computational aspects: 1) our presentation of the algorithms follows the constructionselection paradigm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> instead of the inclusion-exclusion paradigm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. This makes the exposition of the algorithms easier without compromising their computational complexity. 2) We focus on Betti numbers to avoid describing the more involved computation of torsion coefficients in the homology groups. 3) We deal with neither parallelisation nor finite precision.

Using the triangular inequality and that 𝜎 𝑞 is Lipschitz with respect to the operator norm, we can see that for 𝑓 , 𝑔 ∈ 𝐶1 [𝑞],𝑓 (𝑥) 2 + 𝜎 𝑞 (D 𝑥 𝑓 ) 2 -𝑔(𝑥) 2 + 𝜎 𝑞 (D 𝑥 𝑔) 2 ≤ 𝑓 -𝑔 ∞ .From here, we deduce that𝑓 (𝑥) 2 + 𝜎 𝑞 (D 𝑥 𝑓 ) 2 ≤ dist ∞ ( 𝑓 , Σ 1Since orthogonal transformations leave invariant ∞ , we can assume, without loss of generality, that 𝑥 = 𝑒 0 and that V is the identity matrix.
