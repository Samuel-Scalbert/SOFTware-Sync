			<abstract>
<div><p>IEEE 802.11 has emerged as a vital wireless network access technology for mobile devices. By providing the potential for high connectivity speeds, this technology has led to a huge rise in the number of access points (APs). In such environments, mobile devices have the choice to join several Wi-Fi networks. Despite its importance to user Quality of Experience (QoE), the AP selection is still trivial since it focuses at best on the received signal strength if not only the user's history. Crucial metrics that capture the overall dynamics of the AP load condition, such as the network load, are not taken into account. In this paper, we propose to use the Busy Time Fraction (BTF) as a metric to choose the best AP to attach to. The BTF level of a given channel is inferred based on the frame aggregation scheme proposed since the 802.11n standard. In this regard, we build a proof of concept system, FAM (Frame Aggregation based method) that leverages the theoretical frame aggregation levels of a probe traffic returned by two analytical Markovian models and the measured ones in order to estimate not only the BTF but also the nature of the traffic. We validate the accuracy of our proposed approach against <software>ns</software>-3 simulations under several scenarios.</p></div>

<div><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>As one of the cornerstones for delivering flexibility and high speeds, Wireless-Fidelity (Wi-Fi) or IEEE 802.11 has become the most used technology for accessing the Internet. Nearly, all companies, universities, and homes use Wi-Fi to satisfy their connectivity needs, which has led to the explosion of wireless data 5 usage and the colossal rise of Access Points (APs), smartphones, and various mobile devices. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Internet users will exceed 5.3 billion by 2023, and the number of public Wi-Fi hotspots will grow to nearly 628 million. the device's operating system based on the best Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) or the user's history or preferences. RSSI or equivalent metrics may help to estimate the physical transmission rate that will be used. But, these simple criteria do not take into account the load of the channels, APs, or any information relative to the network performance imposed by the other 15 stations and the current traffic. If the network is managed by one authority, it is possible to implement specific functionalities such as the IEEE 802.11k/v amendment to obtain load estimations and, thus, distribute association with respect to load balancing objectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. When the APs are managed by noncooperative authorities or when these kinds of functionalities are not available, 20 the station cannot obtain load estimation from the network and should infer it autonomously.</p><p>Aggressive achievable throughput tests such as Ookla speedtest and iperf have been widely adopted for network performance measurements such as TCP throughput. While throughput tests provide valuable insights into network 25 state, they suffer from high and intrusive generated traffic and dependence on transport and application protocol. Thus, making them a poor choice for performance characterization.</p><p>In contrast to these metrics, the network load seems to be an excellent fit since it conditions the throughput and gives a broader view of the network state 30 independently of the transmission conditions of the device. This latter can be expressed in many ways. In this work, we consider the Busy Time Fraction (BTF), defined as the fraction of time the wireless medium is sensed busy due to successful or unsuccessful transmissions. It captures concurrent transmissions, constituting the AP load, as well as inter-network interference.</p></div>
<div><head>35</head><p>This paper aims at studying the possibility to infer the BTF of the channels used by the AP in its vicinity locally in the user space of a non-rooted vanilla device, typically a smartphone, without modifications on network equipment (STAs and APs). We consider an active probing approach (a probe traffic is sent by a client to a server) to estimate this quantity between two devices 40 connected to the same AP. A possible future application of this work (which is not considered in this paper) is to share these measurements publicly available to build a collective knowledge allowing other devices to choose their AP with respect to their loads and produce their own measures.</p><p>Classical channel load estimation tools are based on time dispersion but 45 cannot be used in Wi-Fi <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Indeed, in the most modern Wi-Fi versions (802.11n, ac, ax, and the most recent roll-up <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>), a frame aggregation scheme has been introduced. This scheme allows an AP or a station (STA) to send several frames through a unique access to the medium and thus making interpacket arrival null. Hopefully, the load of the channel conditions the aggregation 50 level, defined as the number of packets within the same aggregated frame. The contributions of our paper are as follows:</p><p>We propose analytical models based on Markov chains that demonstrate how one could induce the theoretical frame aggregation levels of targeted probe traffic sent from a client to a server concurrent to the cross traffic</p></div>
<div><head>55</head><p>(the competing traffic already present in the network).</p><p>We reveal how the frame aggregation scheme embodies a rich set of Wi-Fi link properties that can be utilized to discern the network load. We illustrate through <software>ns</software>-3 simulations that frame aggregation levels correlate extremely well with the expected BTF across a variety of challenging 60 scenarios. Moreover, we demonstrate that the throughput that a joining device could get depends on whether the competing traffic uses frame aggregation or not.</p><p>We propose a method called Frame Aggregation based Method (FAM) that leverages both the theoretical frame aggregation levels (returned by 65 the analytical models) and the measured ones to estimate not only the BTF but also the nature of the traffic (aggregated or not) which makes it possible to evaluate the available bandwidth that another device would have if it would join the network.</p><p>The proposed method constitutes a proof of concept that shows that the load 70 is inferable locally when the server is close to the client, without any control on the AP. It is worth noting that it is not the definitive application and must potentially be supplemented by other methods depending on the context. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes in detail the background of this work. Section 3 presents our proposed analytical models to 75 estimate the DownLink frame aggregation levels of the probe traffic and their validation. Section 4 exposes the proposed method. Section 5 is dedicated to the performance evaluation and numerical results of the method. Papers that relate to the studied problem are discussed in Section 6. We conclude this paper in Section 7.</p></div>

<div><head n="2.">Background</head><p>Before plunging into the details of our proposed system, we present several key background concepts: frame aggregation scheme and how the AP queue handles packets under the frame aggregation.</p></div>
<div><head n="2.1.">Frame aggregation overview</head></div>
<div><head>85</head><p>Ever since their first introduction in 1997, IEEE 802.11 network has considerably enhanced its throughput by coming with new technological advances to improve the physical (PHY) and the Medium Access Control (MAC) layers. At the MAC layer, one of the significant steps forward was the introduction of the frame aggregation scheme by the IEEE 802.11n standard. Since then, this latter 90 has become the default mechanism of sending data on modern Wi-Fi (802.11n, ac, ax). The general concept of frame aggregation is to allow several frames, that are Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> depicts the structure of an aggregated frame. The A-MPDU aggregation consists in sending several sub-frames (A-MPDU) with a common Wi-Fi physical header (PHY Header). Each sub-frame is composed of an MPDU delimiter, followed by the MPDU, consisting of its own MAC header, MAC payload (a packet or any layer 3 Protocol Data Unit), and Frame Check Sequence (FCS).</p></div>

<div><head n="2.2.">AP queuing system under frame aggregation</head><p>Without frame aggregation and for a given enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) class (an extension of the Distributed Coordination Function scheme that includes Quality of Service traffic prioritization for data packets), 110 the AP pursues a predefined per-packet scheduling method (e.g., First In First Out (FIFO)). It is important to note that building a queuing algorithm is up to product designers that decide how to manage a transmission queue.</p><p>With frame aggregation, the aggregated transmissions act as a batch scheduler which alters the timing characteristics of received packets. To explain this 115 approach, we show an example in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. It consists of an AP queue with two interleaved sequences of packets sent to two different clients, A and B, on a Wi-Fi link. Ai defines the i th packet targeted to client A while Bi is the i th packet destined to client B. In the case depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, the packet at the head of the AP queue is addressed to A. All A's packets (within the limit of the 120 maximum number of aggregated sub-frames) will be aggregated and sent out as an A-MPDU. Then, an aggregated frame with B's packets is sent. In this paper, we consider this approach in order to build the first Markovian model (detailed in Section 3).</p></div>

<div><head n="3.">Analytical models and their validation 125</head><p>In this section, we describe the proposed analytical models that help infer the frame aggregation behavior of the probe traffic as a function of the competing traffic. This competing traffic, called cross traffic, can aggregate its frames or not.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.1.">System model description 130</head><p>We consider a general Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) based on IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) composed of two different entities: an AP and a user station. The station is assumed to be associated with the AP. Each station or AP has its own physical transmission rate. It is a combination of the following parameters: the modulation type and the coding 135 rate which is defined by the Modulation and Coding Scheme index (MCS), the number of spatial streams, the channel width, and the guard interval length. The two proposed analytical models are Discrete-Time Markov chains (DTMC). They appraise the frame aggregation levels of the DownLink probe traffic for a given cross traffic load.As the probe frame aggregation levels depend on the 140 nature of cross traffic (aggregated or non-aggregated traffic), the first chain considers that the cross traffic uses the frame aggregation scheme, whereas the second is based on non-aggregated cross traffic. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> summarizes the principal notations used in the models. Our models rely on the following assumptions: probe traffic: we distinguish two types of probe traffics: 1) the UpLink 145 (UL) probe traffic which is the traffic sent from the probe traffic node to the AP. It is a Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, sent at regular interval d p ; and 2) the DownLink (DL) probe traffic forwarded to the probe server. Frame aggregation scheme is always enabled for this flow.</p><p>Cross traffic: the cross traffic is modeled by a CBR source sending 150 packets at regular interval d c managed by a unique queue. The cross traffic can be either aggregated or not. This flow is coming from the distribution system (a wired network connected to the AP, which is not represented in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and<ref type="figure">5</ref>) and sent to the cross traffic node.</p></div>
<div><head>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f</head><p>Journal Pre-proof are assumed to have a finite size. More precisely, we assume that when an aggregated frame is sent for a given destination, the corresponding buffer becomes empty for this destination. This assumption simplifies drastically the models and their computation. However, the simulation results show that it does not introduce a significant error.</p><p>160</p><p>The cross and probe traffics are modeled as CBR. The two DTMC are embedded chains taken at the end of each transmission. The chains describe the number of frames in the different buffers (AP, cross traffic node, probe traffic node) and the current transmission (which node is transmitting). A new state is then a function of the transmission duration. This time sets the number of 165 frames arriving in the different buffer (as traffics are CBR). To keep the model tractable, we neglect the remaining time for the next arrival after the end of a transmission. The new state also depends on the node that wins access to the medium for the next transmission. As we neglect collisions, the successive accesses are independent. With these assumptions, a new state depends only 170 on the previous one and the chains are Markovian.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.1.1.">Model based on aggregated cross traffic</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> depicts the scenario considered in the model based on aggregated cross traffic. An AP and three stations operate on the same Wi-Fi channel. The AP is connected to a distribution system.</p></div>
<div><head>175</head><p>We now derive a mathematical model that estimates the frame aggregation levels of the DL probe traffic when we consider an aggregated cross traffic. The model aims to be compared with the aggregation levels as measured by the probe traffic server to deduce the cross traffic load (load of the AP or channel). The frame aggregation level of the DL probe traffic depends on the competition  for medium access. In particular, when the cross traffic increases, the DL probe traffic has to wait longer. More packets may hence accumulate in the queue of the AP and be aggregated when the next DL probe transmission occurs.</p><p>We consider the Markov chain defined as (X n , Y n , Z n , S n ) n≥0 . The process X n describes the number of probe packets contained in the AP queue Transition probabilities. Having defined the set of possible states for each pro-195 cess, we shall now derive the transition probabilities. The transition probabilities are denoted P (i,j,k,u)(l,m,q,v) , and represent the probability to go from state</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(X n , Y n , Z n , S n ) = (i, j, k, u) to state (X n+1 , Y n+1 , Z n+1 , S n+1 ) = (l, m, q, v).</formula><p>For convenience, we also define the following function where A and B take their values in the set {AP C, AP P, SP }:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">200 β (B,l,m,q) (A) = P S n+1 = AP C|S n = AP P, X n+1 = l, Y n+1 = m, Z n+1 = q</formula><p>The transition probabilities depend on the time between two successive transmissions. As both UL probe and UL cross traffics are deterministic, this time sets the number of packets that arrived in the AP buffer and the probing client buffer between two transmissions and thus the number of frames that will be sent in the next aggregated frame. We therefore analyze the events that may occur between two successive transmissions. The next stage of our modeling is to decide when a transition from one state to another is allowed and to compute its probability. Note that impossible transitions have zero probability and that non-null transition probabilities are computed assuming that all concerned nodes are equally likely to access the channel. For ease of illustration, 210 we categorize the state transitions into the following three classes.</p><p>Class I:Transition from state APP. For the sake of clarity, we recourse to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref> to describe the possible transition probabilities and their computations. It illustrates an example of possible events between two successive transmissions when the current state is APP (an aggregated frame containing 215 probe packets is transmitted by the AP). In this example, at time t = 0, we start from state (i, j, k, AP P ) (i.e (3,2,2,APP) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>). The AP sends the i corresponding probe frames currently in its buffer (i = 3 in this example), aggregating them in a single A-MPDU using its current MCS. Its transmission duration is denoted T AP (i) which is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Note that the AP has a single 220 buffer that contains at once the probe and the cross traffics but in order to clarify the explanation of the model, we distinguish between them in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>.</p><p>During this transmission, the probe traffic node buffer receives TAP (i) dp packets and the AP buffer receives TAP (i) dc cross packets. As a result, at the end of the APP state, the probe traffic node buffer and the AP will contain respec-225 tively, k + TAP (i) dp of probe packets and j + TAP (i) dc of cross traffic packets ((4,4) in the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>).</p><p>At the end of this transmission, the buffer of the AP does not have probe frames to send (X n+1 = 0 almost surely), and another APP transmission is impossible (S n+1 = AP P almost surely). So from this state, only two transitions 230 are allowed: to APC or SP with X n+1 = l = 0. It can occur only if Y n+1 = m &gt; 0 and Z n+1 = q &gt; 0 respectively.</p><p>We derive the non-null transition probabilities as follows. If the AP gains access to the channel, it will send the cross traffic currently in its buffer. For m &gt; 0, the next transmission will be APC with probability:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">235 P (i,j,k,AP P )(0,m,q,AP C) = β (AP P,0,m,q) (AP C) • 1 k+ T AP (i) dp =q • 1 j+ T AP (i) dc =m (1)</formula><p>where 1 condition is the indicator function that equals to 1 if condition is true and 0 otherwise. P S n+1 = AP C|S n = AP P, X n+1 = l = 0, Y n+1 = m &gt; 0, Z n+1 = q denotes the probability that the event APC will occur given that the event APP has already occurred. The computation of these probabilities is detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Now, if the probe station gains access, the next event will be SP 240 and the transition probability from APP to SP for q &gt; 0 is given by: Class II:Transition from state APC. Once again, when presenting the transition probabilities of this class, we resort to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>. It depicts a timeline of feasible events between two successive transmission departures when we start from the state APC.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P (i,j,k,AP P )(l,m,q,SP ) = β (AP P,0,m,q) (SP ) • 1 k+ T AP (i) dp =q • 1 j+ T AP (i) dc =m (2)</formula></div>
<div><head>245</head><p>The AP sends the j cross traffic frames currently in its buffer as an A-MPDU using the transmission rate associated to the cross traffic server. Its transmission duration is denoted T AC (j). During the period T AC (j), the probe traffic client buffer receives TAC (j) dp packets and the AP buffer receives TAC (j) dc cross traffic packets. At the end of the APC state, the probe traffic client buffer and the 250 AP will thus contain respectively, k + TAC (j) dp of probe packets and TAC (j) dc of cross traffic packets.</p><p>For this class of transitions, there are three possible transitions: S n+1 can be APP, APC, or SP. First, we suppose that there will be another APC, the transition from APC to APC is deemed possible if and only if X n = i = 0 and 255 Y n = l = 0: it is impossible to have two successive APC transmissions if i &gt; 0 or l &gt; 0 due to the AP queuing system detailed in Section 2.2. The transition probability from APC to APC with Y n+1 = m &gt; 0 is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P (0,j,k,AP C)(0,m,q,AP C) = β (AP C,0,m,q) (AP C) • 1 T AC (j) dc =m • 1 k+ T AC (j) dp =q<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Now if we suppose that the AP gains the medium access to transmit the DL probe flow, the transition probability from APC to APP is possible only if 260 X n = i = X n+1 = l since the AP cannot receive probe frames in its buffer during the transmission of the cross traffic and X n+1 = l &gt; 0. The corresponding probability is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P (i,j,k,AP C)(l,m,q,AP P ) = β (AP C,l,m,q) (AP P ) • 1 T AC (j) dc =m • 1 k+ T AC (j) dp =q (4)</formula><p>If we assume that the probe traffic client gains the medium access, the transition from APC to SP is also allowed only if X n+1 = l = X n = i and 265 Z n+1 = q &gt; 0.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P (i,j,k,AP C)(l,m,q,SP ) = β (AP C,l,m,q) (SP ) • 1 T AC (j) dc =m • 1 k+ T AC (j) dp =q (5)</formula><p>Class III:Transition from state SP. In order to derive the transition probabilities of the last class, we apply the same principle. Due to space limitations, we do not describe the details of the derived transition probabilities.</p><p>From the SP state, there are three possible transitions APP, APC, or SP de-270 pending on the competition for the channel resource. First, if the next transition is APP with X n+1 = l &gt; 0, the transition probability is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P (i,j,k,SP )(l,m,q,AP P ) = β (SP,l,m,q) (AP P ) • 1 l=i+k • 1 j+ T SP (k) dc =m • 1 T SP (k) dp =q<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Second, if the next transition is APC with Y n+1 = m &gt; 0, the transition probability is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P (i,j,k,SP )(l,m,q,AP C) = β (SP,l,m,q) (AP C) • 1 l=i+k • 1 j+ T SP (k) dc =m • 1 T SP (k) dp =q (7)</formula><p>Finally, if the next transition is SP with Z n+1 = q &gt; 0, the transition 275 probability is thus formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">P (i,j,k,SP )(l,m,q,SP ) = β (SP,l,m,q) (SP ) • 1 l=i+k • 1 j+ T SP (k) dc =m • 1 T SP (k) dp =q (8)</formula></div>
<div><head n="3.1.2.">Model based on aggregated cross traffic</head><p>Let us now derive the second Markov chain where the frame aggregation scheme is disabled for the cross traffic.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> breaks down the network topology simulated by this model that 280 consists of two co-located WLANs.The first one enable the frame aggregation scheme (e.g., IEEE 802.11n in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>) and the second one disable the frame aggregation (e.g., IEEE 802.11g). The WLAN where aggregation is enabled is composed of an AP and two nodes.  Class I: Transition from APP. We first consider the transition probabilities when the current transmission is APP. Since during this transmission, the 802.11n AP sends an aggregated probe frame to the probe traffic server, the transitions probabilities from state APP are the same. The computation of the 295 conditional probabilities related to these three classes are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. If the 802.11g AP gains access to the channel, the transition probability from state APP to state APC with Y n+1 = m &gt; 0 is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P (i,j,k,AP P )(0,m,q,AP C) = β (AP P,0,m,q) (AP C) • 1 k+ T AP (i) dp =q • 1 j+ T AP (i) dc =m<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Now if the probe traffic node gains the competition for the channel resource, the transition from APP to SP with Z n+1 = q &gt; 0 is given by: 300 P (i,j,k,AP P )(l,m,q,SP ) = β (AP P,0,m,q) (SP ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> Class II: Transition from APC.

Here, there are three possible transitions. The process S n+1 can be APP, APC, or SP.

<div><head n="3.3.">Numerical results</head><p>In this section, we evaluate the accuracy of the proposed models in estimating the frame aggregation levels of the probe traffic. We do so under several scenarios with different network parameters, such as the topology and its size, 340 different IEEE 802.11 amendments, and different traffic patterns. In this regard, we compare the aggregation levels given by the models with those delivered by the discrete-event network simulator 3 (<software>ns</software>-3 version 3.30). For simplicity reasons, we assume for all the scenarios that all nodes have a random but fixed position during the whole simulation duration. We compute the two models for 345 six cross traffic loads/BTF levels: 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, and 0.625 ranging from low to high levels of BTF. The maximum numbers of aggregated packets AM P DU P and AM P DU AP are set to 36. Our Markov models are solved through simulation. We start by fixing the initial state (the number of packets in each buffer and the first possible transition, e.g., APP) and the number of 350 iterations (10000 in our case). Based on the buffer states and the computed transitions probabilities, we then ran the model in order to compute the probe mean aggregation levels.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.3.1.">Validation of the model based on aggregated cross traffic</head><p>We examine the accuracy of the first model where the frame aggregation 355 scheme is enabled for both probe and cross traffics under the 802.11n standard amendment.</p><p>Scenario #1 -Same MCS. We start by examining the performance details of this model when the same MCS index (HT-MCS15 with a physical transmission rate of 144.4 Mbps) is used for the probe traffic node and the AP. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> 360</p><p>shows the mean aggregation level for the probe traffic as a function of the probe packet gap for the model and simulations. We let the probe packet gap gradually varies from 50µs to 1000µs. According to these results, it appears that the model performs well since it follows closely the pattern of the <software>ns</software>-3 simulations for the three levels of the network loads (0.25, 0.375, and 0.5). It is also the 365 case for the three other BTFs (0, 0.125, and 0.625) that are not shown here. We can observe that the aggregation levels depend on the loads of the network. Indeed, when the BTF increases, the probe traffic has to wait longer, and more packets are received between two successive probe transmissions.    Scenario #2 -Different MCS indexes. We now evaluate the performance 370 details of the first model when different MCS indexes are used for the probe traffic node and the AP. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8</ref> shows the corresponding results. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8a</ref> plots the results when we use the MCS 15 (144.4 Mbps) for the AP to send the DL probe traffic and the cross traffic and the MCS11 (57.8 Mbps) for the probing node. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">8b</ref> provides the corresponding results when we use MCS15 375 for the AP and MCS13 (115.6 Mbps) for the probe traffic node. The results show that considering different MCS indexes for the AP and the probe traffic node does not impact the accuracy of our approach.</p><p>Scenario #3 -Exponential On/Off cross traffic. To provide a broader overview of the accuracy reached by the proposed modeling approach, this sce-380 nario simulates another traffic pattern for the cross traffic which is exponential On/Off traffic, reflecting some of the kinds of cross traffic that would occur in practice. In <software>ns</software>-3, we use exponentially distributed On/Off periods thanks to the <software>ns</software>-3 OnOff Application class. This latter mainly relies on an OffTime and OnTime duration attributes that represent respectively the duration dur-385 ing which the data transfer is switched off and the duration of the continuous data transfer. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref> shows the mean aggregation levels for the BTFs 0.125, 0.25 and 0.375. These results show that the estimations made by our model fit those delivered by <software>ns</software>-3 for the exponential On/Off aggregated cross traffic. We conclude that the proposed models still perform well under exponential On/Off  Scenario #4 -802.11ax traffic. Here, we run the first model when both the probe and cross traffics use the 802.11ax standard. All the nodes use the data rate=286.8Mbps. It is noticeable from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10</ref> that the mean aggregation levels obtained with simulations fit the ones from the model.</p></div>

<div><head>Validation of the model based on non-aggregated cross traffic</head><p>Extensive comparisons between the model based on non-aggregated cross traffic under several scenarios and simulations are detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The model is able to reproduce the DL probe traffic aggregation behavior with a satisfying degree of precision. The number of stations composing the DL competing traffic 400 coming from the same AP does not influence the estimations for the model.</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11a</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11b</ref> show the probe mean aggregation levels for six BTFs depending on the frame aggregation scheme. Varying the level of cross traffic barely affects the probe aggregation levels when the BT F &gt; 0.25. In this case, each cross traffic frame is sent independently, with short transmission times.</p></div>
<div><head>405</head><p>Consequently, the probe traffic receives less packets to aggregate between two consecutive medium accesses. Also, cross traffic reaches saturation faster (as it sends less frames on average). As soon as it has always a frame to send, its access time does not depend on its buffer state. Consequently, the aggregation level of the probe traffic becomes insensitive to the level of congestion of the 410 cross traffic. On the contrary (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11a</ref>), when cross traffic aggregates its frames, the state of its buffer has a deeper impact on probe traffic aggregation since the cross traffic buffer state determines the transmission duration. Indeed, varying the level of the aggregated network load significantly affects the probe aggregation levels. Consequently, the results are sufficiently separated to be 415 used to infer the load level (Section 4).</p></div>
<div><head n="4.">Description of the method FAM</head><p>The results presented in the previous section indicates a strong correlation between the aggregation levels of the probe traffic and the network load. In this section, we hence introduce a network load inference method called Frame  We unfold the details of the proposed approach by exposing the algorithmic 430 representation of each stride. Each step relies on one or many algorithms. We note that all the algorithms detailed below are implemented on the server (the client procedure is not shown under its algorithm form).</p></div>
<div><head n="4.1.">Mean aggregation level</head><p>Initially, we start with the measurement of the aggregation levels of the probe 435 traffic. Probing nodes (the client) begins by sending successive batches of probe packets. For each batch, the gap interval between packets, d p , is increased from d pmin to d pmax . In order to evaluate the mean aggregation levels accurately while keeping the batch size as small a possible, the number of packets in a batch np is not fixed. This number is determined in the server procedure (Algorithm 1).</p></div>

It receives and processes the incoming probe packets from the probe traffic node. During a given batch, the mean aggregation 445 is computed on the fly at the reception of probe packets. We use the CLT to evaluate the accuracy of the mean aggregation levels. When the error is lower than the expected error E, the server sends the convergence notification to the probe node (that stops its batch). The use of the CLT allows the application to appropriately measure the mean aggregation level with a minimal amount of 450 time and bandwidth cost.</p></div>
<div><head n="4.2.">Cross traffic nature</head><p>Having already computed the mean aggregation levels of the probe traffic, we now proceed with the cross traffic type estimation. Our intuition and reasoning to assess the cross traffic nature is based on the idea that, if the cross traffic does 455 not aggregate, its channel access time becomes constant when the channel load increases. This time is defined here as the time the cross traffic uses the channel between two successive probe traffic accesses. It corresponds to T AC + T AC in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>. The cross traffic access time depends only on the successive number of times it accesses the channel and the time to transmit a single frame. When 460 the two buffers (cross and probe) are non-empty, it becomes independent of the number of frames/packets in these buffers and thus on the probe and traffic loads. On the contrary, when the cross traffic aggregates its frames, this time is increasing with the load as A-MPDU contains more aggregated frames.</p><p>We use this observation to detect the nature of the cross traffic. The mean 465 cross traffic access time is denoted T C . If this time is constant with d p and with the load, we can express the mean aggregation level for the probe traffic, meanAgg, through a fixed point equation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">meanAgg = min K max , f (meanAgg) d p + T C d p<label>(17)</label></formula><p>The rational of this equation is that the mean number of aggregated frames (meanAgg on the left-hand side of the equation) is equal to the number of 470 frames received at the buffer since the last probe transmission. In Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>, we would get X n+1 = TAP (Xn) dp + TAC +TAC dp . Substituting (X n , X n+1 ) by the mean aggregation (X n = X n+1 = meanAgg) and assuming that the cross traffic access time is constant, (T AC + T AC ) becomes T C for this example), we obtain the Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">17</ref>.</p></div>
<div><head>475</head><p>This approach is described in Algorithm 2. It takes as input the mean aggregation level for the probe and computes T C , according to equation 17, for each probe packet gap d p . It keeps only values of T C for which TAP (meanAgg) dp + TC dp is less than K max . Then, it returns the percentage of variation between the maximum and minimum of these values. In Algorithm 4, this percentage is 480 compared to a given threshold to determine if T C can be considered as constant (cross traffic does not aggregate) or not (cross traffic aggregates).</p></div>

<div><head n="4.3.">BTF estimation</head><p>Having already computed the mean aggregation levels and discussed how to determine the type of the concurrent traffic, we now detail how to estimate 485 the network of a wireless channel via its BTF. Two methods are proposed to estimate the BTF. They are both based on the comparison between the mean aggregation levels given by our Markov chains and the measures made for different probe traffic batches. First, the mean error can be computed as the sum of the difference between the model and the measures as follows.</p></div>

Alternatively, Algorithm 3 considers a notion of score to infer the BTF. For each probe packet gap d p and a given model, the BTF that minimizes the error scores Algorithm 4 gives the final output of our method. First, it evaluates if the BTF is less or equals to 0.25. We have observed that, for such a low load, it is difficult to distinguish precisely the nature of the traffic since the cross traffic tends to have very small mean aggregation levels. In this case, no precision on 500 the aggregation is given. If the BTF is greater than 0.25 at least for one of the two models, it computes the percentage of variation of T C with Algorithm 2 and compares it to a threshold T . It determines if the cross traffic access time can be considered as constant and consequently if the cross traffic aggregates or not. For both cases, the corresponding BTF is returned with the cross traffic 505 nature. </p></div>

<div><head n="5.">Performance Evaluation</head><p>In this section, we evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method FAM by relying mainly upon the same <software>ns</software>-3 scenarios used in the Section 3 that expose different network parameters, different IEEE 802.11 amendments, and different 510 traffic patterns. The parameters of our method are as follow. Similar to the analytical models, we compute the four Markovian models for six cross traffic loads/BTF levels: 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, and 0.625 ranging from low to high levels of BTF. In algorithm 1, the FAM method uses a 95% confidence interval (Z = 1.96) and an error E = 0.05. The CLT results indicated that the 515 relevant number of packets to send increases proportionally to the probe rate. The number of sent packets ranges between 600 and 3800. In algorithm 4, the threshold T is chosen according to an empirical method. Our simulations and experiments have shown that a value of T = 200% offers good performances. For instance, we take different values for the parameter T that depend on the 520 device's transmission rate. These values are known by FAM.</p></div>
<div><head n="5.1.">FAM validation for aggregated cross traffic scenarios</head><p>In this section, we assess the effectiveness of FAM when relying on the theoretical aggregation levels returned by the models when the cross traffic uses or not the frame aggregation feature.

We now study the case when all the nodes (AP and STAs) use the same MCS index (MCS15 corresponding to 144.4 Mbps). We reuse the three-STAs scenario of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> presents the estimated 530 BTF and cross traffic nature for the considered scenario. The ground truth column gives the real value of the BTF. In the table, 'S' indicates the BTF and cross traffic nature that were set in the simulations, and 'A' presents the value returned by our algorithm FAM. We note that FAM finds the good result when the two letters ('S'/'A') are in the same box. As FAM does not return the cross 535 traffic nature when the load is lower than 0.25, we set 'S' and 'A' in the two corresponding boxes (aggregated and non-aggregated cross traffic) in this case. Results presented in this table show that the method finds the good results for all the levels of BTF.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> to study the accuracy of our approach under nodes (AP and STAs) that have different data rates. We use the MCS15 (144.4 Mbps) for the AP to send the DL probe traffic and the cross traffic and the MCS11 (57.8 Mbps) for the probing node (scenario 1). Then, we use MCS15 for the AP and MCS13 (115.6 Mbps) for the probe traffic node (scenario 2). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows 545 the results of scenario 2. We can observe that the method finds the good results for the five BTFs 0, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, and 0.625 and slightly overestimates the BTF for the case 0.125. This error is only of 0.125 (approximately 10%) and is due to the fact that we neglect some protocol aspects, such as the beacons sent</p></div>

It can be seen that FAM predicts reasonably well the BTF values and the cross traffic nature for the 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375 and 0.625 cases and slightly overestimates the BTF for the 0.5 case. Overall, despite a slight discrepancy in estimating the precise level of BTF in some cases, the results returned by the method are in good agreement 560 with those provided by the simulations. topology is the same as the scenario depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.

It can be seen that FAM predicts reasonably well the BTF values for all the cases except the fifth case: BTF=0.5 with 10% of error. In addition, it predicts well the nature of the traffic for all the cases.</p></div>

<div><head n="5.2.">FAM validation for non-aggregated cross traffic scenarios</head><p>We use this section to validate the accuracy of our method FAM when we 575 consider the models' outcomes based on aggregated and non-aggregated cross traffic. We here consider non-aggregated cross traffic scenarios. Analogously to the previous section, we validate the method by comparing its estimation to the results delivered by the network simulator. We here evaluate FAM's accuracy when we used the scenario described in 580 Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, where an 802.11n WLAN and an 802.11g WLAN were deployed. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> shows that FAM estimates well the BTF and the type of the traffic for the cases 0, 0.25, 0.3.75, 0.5 and 0.625 and overestimates the BTF for the case BTF=0.125. Unfortunately, the Wi-Fi link may experience several transient effects in practice. Since the analytical model neglects some protocol aspects such 585 as beacons and MAC losses, it underestimates the aggregation level for some probe packet gaps. As a result, FAM overestimates the BTF which is typically a better outcome for most applications than an aggressive underestimate. We also evaluated the case where there are several cross traffic STAs. The results show the same tendency. For instance, with 6 STAs (4 STAs receive cross 590 traffic) the method finds the good BTF level except for a BTF=0.125 where the method gives 0.375. is ideal. It is therefore modeled as if the server were implemented on the AP. However, the model presented here appraises the aggregation levels of the DL probe traffic by considering that the server is embedded on a second wireless device which is more realistic and practical.</p><p>640 Crowd-sensing.

<div><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have proposed analytical models that predict the DownLink aggregation levels of a targeted probe traffic concurrent to cross traffic that can aggregate or not its frames. Based on that, we proposed a method that allows a vanilla device, in particular a smartphone, to estimate the expected network load 665 via the Busy Time Fraction and infer if the current traffic aggregates its frames or not. Our models and our method were validated through <software>ns</software>-3 simulations across a variety of scenarios. Overall, from a general view point and for almost all the tested scenarios, we find that the models and the method estimate with a satisfactory degree of precision the aggregation levels of the probe traffic and the 670 Busy Time Fraction respectively with at most 10% of errors. Based on six levels of network loads from to 0 to 0.625 with a resolution of 0.125, FAM seeks to classify the APs into three classes according to the network load: low, medium, and high loaded APs. It therefore compares APs with each others to detect the APs that are less loaded and provide guidance to hierarchize different WLANs.</p><p>675 However, we should note that if an application needs better resolution, FAM can be adapted according to this new resolution.</p></div><figure xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: An Example of scheduling under frame aggregation.</figDesc></figure>

<div><head n="6.">Related work</head><p>Performance evaluation of Wi-Fi networks has been intensely studied in the literature to offer relevant information and methods to help its configuration 595 and improvement. In this paper, we focus on three categories of work: Available bandwidth estimation, crowd-sensing of wireless networks, and Analytical models.</p><p>Available bandwidth estimation. Conversely to achievable throughput estimation tools, there exists another pivotal metric for estimating the overall 600 network performance which is the available bandwidth. Active Available bandwidth measurements that involve the usage of probing packets can be generally divided into two categories: Packet Rate Model (PRM) and Probe Gap Model (PGM). The works based on PRM, such as TOPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, pathload <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, pathChirp <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and DietTOPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, focus on comparing the probe packet and received packet 605 rates. They inject increasing probe traffic in the network path and try to find the point where link congestion starts occurring to discern the available bandwidth. These methods differ according to the probing rate settlement.</p><p>Conversely to PRM, PGM techniques (e.g., Spruce <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, IGI/PTR (Initial Gap Increase/Packet Transmission Rate) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Delphi <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>...) leverage the dis-610 persion in time between two received packets to infer the cross traffic. All these approaches were primitively focused on wired networks and unfortunately failed with the complexity of CSMA/CA of Wi-Fi networks. To cope with this latter, more complex schemes were developed, such as Exact <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <software>IdleGap</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and WBest <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. These techniques intensely depend on the fact that the received 615 packet rate or packet gap should be an effective indicator to reveal the cross traffic. However, the dissimilar packet scheduling system under frame aggregation, proposed by modern Wi-Fi versions, prevents the use of these techniques as inter-packet arrival becomes null when they were embedded in the same aggregated frame. For monitoring the network conditions of these new versions of 620 Wi-Fi, WBest+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and AIWC <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> use the characteristics of frame aggregation to discern the available bandwidth by relying on a threshold-based method: if an inter-arrival time is less than a given threshold, the two packets are considered as aggregated. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, the mean aggregation level is compared to the one of an analytical model to estimate the network load. The network scenario 625 used in these papers consists of a server with a wired Internet connection that sends <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> or receives <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> probing traffic along the network path to/from a client with a last-hop wireless connection that assumed to be the bottleneck. The scenario considered here is different as both the probe traffic generator and the receiver are associated with the same Wi-Fi AP. The behavior of the mean 630 aggregation is then much more complex as it may be different on the uplink and downlink links due to their different parameters (e.g., MCS). Moreover, the probe traffic accesses twice the channel that decreases the level of probe traffic for which the network becomes saturated and the size of the aggregated frames. While evaluating the probe aggregation levels of the UL probe traffic, the model 635 presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> assumes that the connection between the AP and the server  • key words:Wi-Fi, Crowd-sensing, <software>Android</software>, <software>APISENSE</software>.</p></div>
