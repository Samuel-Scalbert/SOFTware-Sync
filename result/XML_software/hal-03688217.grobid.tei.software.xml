<div><head>Introduction</head><p>The study of cell biology dynamics, such as intracellular membrane transport inward (i.e. endocytosis) and outward (i.e. exocytosis/ recycling), has been difficult or at least incomplete until recently, due to the heterogeneity of the motion behavior of the analyzed structures. Different tracking software have been published <ref type="bibr">[e.g. utrack (Jaqaman et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">), </ref>, <ref type="bibr">MTT (Serge et al., 2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">MSSEF-TSAKF (Jaiswal et al., 2015)</ref>, <software ContextAttributes="used">maptrack</software> <ref type="bibr">(Feng et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">), Cell Tracking Profiler (Mitchell et al., 2020)</ref>, <software ContextAttributes="used">btrack</software> <ref type="bibr">(Ulicna et al., 2021)</ref>] to track individual biomolecules or extended objects with a shape, such as cells <ref type="bibr">[e.g. </ref> and <ref type="bibr">CellProfiler (Stirling et al., 2021)</ref>], to obtain spatial information and to quantify their kinetics. Most of them focus on the accuracy and reproducibility of the analysis but the user interfaces remain complex or even limited to a two-dimensional representation. The development of a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) therefore appears necessary to facilitate the selection of parameters, the analysis and the visualization of 3D þ time trajectories estimated from complex 3D videos. The use of Python, a versatile and free programming language is growing rapidly within the bioimaging user community <ref type="bibr">(Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2022)</ref>. Python tools for visualization <ref type="bibr">[e.g. </ref>, <software ContextAttributes="used">ipyvolume</software> <ref type="bibr">(Breddels et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">), SeeVis (Hattab &amp; Nattkemper, 2019)</ref>] and analysis <ref type="bibr">[ZeroCostDL4Mic (von Chamier et al., 2021)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" /><ref type="bibr">), Cellpose (Stringer et al., 2021)</ref>] are widely applied to microscopy images.</p><p>On the other hand, a lot of particle tracking approaches have been developed over the last decades. Interestingly, although a number of studies aimed at comparing particle tracking performance have been published <ref type="bibr">(Carter et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cheezum et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chenouard et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ruusuvuori et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Smal &amp; Meijering, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Smal et al., 2010)</ref>, none of the tested methods seems to perform in a generic way, regardless of the type of image data. As a consequence, it is critical for users to have the possibility to test different detectors and/or trackers in order to identify the best solution for their application. In addition, efforts in the Python community includes particle tracking packages such as <software ContextAttributes="used">TrackPy</software> <ref type="bibr">(Allan et al., 2021)</ref>. <software ContextAttributes="used">TrackPy</software> is a complete particle tracking toolkit, but the code can be a barrier for non-expert user.</p><p>Here, we present <software>STracking</software>, an open-source Python <software ContextAttributes="used">library</software> for combining algorithms into standardized particles tracking pipelines for biological microscopy images. <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking</software> is distributed under a BSD 3-Clause 'New' or 'Revised' License. <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking</software> combines particle detection, tracking and analysis methods and can be used via a <software ContextAttributes="used">napari</software> plugin. <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking</software> contributes to the recent ecosystem of Python-based plugins for bioimage analysis.</p></div>
<div><head>Implementation and application</head><p><software>STracking</software> breaks down a particle tracking pipeline into five components: (i) frame-by-frame particle detection; (ii) particle linking; (iii) analysis of particle properties; (iv) design of track features; and (v) filtering of tracks. Each component is represented as a Python object.</p><p>Each component can be implemented separately. This modular design makes it easy to update and facilitates interoperability with other plugins/algorithms. Whenever a new detection or tracker algorithm is added, compatibility is guaranteed with the particle tracking pipeline, and it is versioned within the <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking library</software>. Several particle detectors are available in <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking</software>: Difference of Gaussian, Determinant of Hessian and Laplacian of Gaussian from the Python <software ContextAttributes="used">library</software> <software ContextAttributes="used">scikit-image</software> (van der <ref type="bibr">Walt et al., 2014)</ref>. In addition, <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking</software> includes a mask detector, called <software ContextAttributes="used">SSegDetector</software>. This detector takes a label or binary mask as input image and returns a list of object positions (centroids of connected components).</p><p>Moreover, <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking</software> includes a tracker <ref type="bibr">(Matov et al., 2011)</ref> that estimates the optimal tracks as follows: first, a connection graph is created with all the possible connections. Second, tracks are iteratively extracted from the graph using shortest path and graph pruning.</p><p><software ContextAttributes="used">STracking library</software> uses two data structures: 'SParticles' to manage the set of detected particles and 'STracks' to manage the collection of trajectories. These data structures contain <software ContextAttributes="used">SciPy</software> (Virtanen et al., 2020) objects to store the particles and the tracks. The particles are represented with a 2D numpy array where each row is dedicated to a specific particle and columns are [T, Z, Y, X] for 3D data and [T, Y, X] for 2D data. The properties of particles are stored in a dictionary. Similarly, tracks are stored in a 2D numpy array where each row is dedicated to specific particle and columns are [trackID, T, Z, Y, X] for 3D data and [trackID, T, Y, X] for 2D data. Tracks features and split/merge events are stored using dictionaries. This data representation is the same as <software ContextAttributes="used">napari</software> (Sofroniew et al., 2021) points and tracks layers, making <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking</software> natively compatible with the <software ContextAttributes="used">napari</software> viewer. We thus implemented a <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking</software> <software ContextAttributes="used">napari</software> plugin suite (<software ContextAttributes="used">napari</software>-tracks-reader, naparistracking). It provides a graphical interface to create a <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking</software> pipeline without writing Python <software ContextAttributes="used">code</software>. <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking</software> could be used as <software ContextAttributes="used">script</software> in Python or <software ContextAttributes="used">napari</software> plugin. The <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking library</software> can be combined with other Python <software ContextAttributes="used">packages</software> to extend <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking</software> functionalities. The <software ContextAttributes="used">napari</software> plugin allows one to perform a full <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking</software> pipeline, or to load detections or tracks from another software such as <ref type="bibr">StarDist (Schmidt et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">), </ref> or u-track <ref type="bibr">(Jaqaman et al., 2008)</ref> and continue the analysis with <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking</software> and <software ContextAttributes="used">napari</software>. Documentation on <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking library</software> with examples is available at https://sylvainprigent.github.io/stracking/. <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking</software> documentation was created using <software ContextAttributes="used">sphinx</software> and the autodoc extension.</p><p><software ContextAttributes="used">STracking</software> pipeline using the <software ContextAttributes="used">napari</software> plugin is illustrated with data obtained in Lattice Light-Sheet Structured Illumination Microscopy (Chen et al., 2014)(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Supplementary Video S1). The <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking</software> workflow could also be implemented using Jupyter notebook (Supplementary Note S1). Additionally, <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking library</software> can be used for cell migration experiments (Supplementary Note S2) using label mask images produced by other software such as CellPose <ref type="bibr">(Stringer et al., 2021)</ref>  </p></div>
<div><head>Conclusions</head><p>The <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking library</software> simplifies the design of single particle tracking workflows through a graphical interface using <software ContextAttributes="used">napari</software> and a comprehensive Python <software ContextAttributes="used">library</software> of functions. Unlike previous single particle tracking tools in Python ecosystem, it provides a very flexible solution for processing and visualizing the tracks taking advantage of <software ContextAttributes="used">Napari <ref type="bibr">(Sofroniew et al., 2021)</ref> viewer</software> for 3D þ time representation. A similar approach was introduced in <software ContextAttributes="used">TrackMate</software> software <ref type="bibr">(Tinevez et al., 2017)</ref> for the visualization and validation of 2D tracks in <software ContextAttributes="used">Fiji</software> (Schindelin et al., 2012) java-based environment. Thus, reproducible analysis can be performed without being an expert programmer. For this purpose, <software ContextAttributes="used">STracking library</software> includes a pipeline class to allow executing a tracking pipeline recorded as a json file. We would point out that this plugin-implemented recording technique is not an optimal software architecture since it should be done by the host platform. To overcome this difficulty, we recommend using a powerful data management software such as the recent <software ContextAttributes="used">BioImageIT</software> platform <ref type="bibr">(Prigent et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>In summary, the <software>STracking</software> <software ContextAttributes="used">library</software> greatly simplifies the inspection and optimization of single particle tracking algorithms and thus allows the evaluation of new detection and tracker algorithms in this context, which are constantly being developed.</p></div><figure xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1. Overview of STracking library implemented in its napari plugin (a-c) and Jupyter Notebook (Kluyver et al., 2016) (d-f). Fifty-five planes 3D volumes of live RPE1 cells double stained with PKMR for Mitochondria (magenta) and with plasma membrane deep red (PMDR) for endosomal pathway (green) were acquired within 4.3 s per stack using Lattice light-sheet Structure Illumination Microscopy (LLS-SIM).
