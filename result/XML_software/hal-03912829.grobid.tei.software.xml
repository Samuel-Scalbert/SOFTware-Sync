<div><head n="1.">Introduction 1.Compliant mechanisms</head><p>As a unique and novel branch of robotic systems, Compliant Mechanisms (CMs) have been presenting their inherent advantages in many existing engineering applications over the last few decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Unlike conventional rigid-body mechanisms, CMs are most likely to be designed monolithic, serving as devices to transfer motion, force, and energy only through the deformation of the built-in elementary flexible components. According to the state of the art, CMs have demonstrated many meaningful advantages over conventional rigid-body ones, such as increased motion precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, simplified manufacturing process <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, reduced weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, cost reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and less maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Due to these mentioned merits, CMs have been integrated into many engineering applications, serving as a type of promising alternative to conventional rigid mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Besides, slender straight beams and ICBs are mostly utilized as the elementary flexible components in CMs: straight beams present relatively ideal degrees of freedom (DoF) and degrees of constraint (DoC), serving as a suitable choice for high-accuracy positioning CMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>; ICBs are commonly used in large-deflection CMs, such as bi/tri-stable CMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and path-generating CMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, due to their large deflection range however with a relatively small strain range. Therefore, the efficient methods for modeling nonlinear (intermediate or large) deflection of the mentioned two types of slender beams are highly needed for conducting static synthesis of a whole CM. Fortunately, several impressive and great contributions have been completed by the pioneering researchers, which are reviewed in the next section.</p></div>
<div><head n="1.2.">Literature review about static modeling of slender beams in the field of CMs</head><p>To properly design and then optimize flexure-based CMs, accurate and efficient modeling approaches are of great importance. Logically, the mentioned static modeling process highly depends on that of the involved flexible components as the thick parts are normally treated/assumed as rigid bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. In this short review section, we only take into account the commonly-used modeling methods in the research community of CMs.</p><p>Indeed, the key essence behind large-deflection scenarios of general planar beams lies in geometrically nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, which is essentially a BVP of an ODE. Howell introduced elliptical integrals to handle this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which has been the most accurate solution to this beam theory since then. For straightforward implementation, Howell and his co-authors then introduced a more designer-friendly approximation method called pseudo-rigid-body model (PRBM), serving as an efficient modeling method in the early stages of the design process, which has proved its effectiveness in many engineering cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Much work has been completed regarding its derivatives afterwards <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> for its widespread use. Besides, according to the current literature of CMs, the most commonly-used numerical beam model termed as BCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, has been serving as an effective modeling tool in beam-deflection problems since then. Essentially, BCM is also derived from geometrically nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory by making some approximations on the curvature of the modeled beams <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Its derivatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> have also been quite popular primarily due to the success of the original BCM. Furthermore, Finite Element Method (FEM) is a widely used method for numerically solving differential equations arising in engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and in this case, beam-deflection problems can be theoretically described using the governing equations behind solid mechanics and beam theory respectively and logically solved by FEM. It is reliable so many researchers from different research areas tend to use it as a means of verifying their own mathematical models. (Note that here FEM specifically refers to the reliable and accurate post-optimized algorithm built in commercial software or researchers' own coding). In 2020, a comprehensive CM review has been completed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> where the authors mentioned another type of modeling method: chained algorithm. Here, we would like to recall its original definition in Howell's classic work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>: "The chained algorithm requires discretization of the object being modeled into beam elements and each element is analyzed in succession, the chained algorithm is similar to finite element method and lends itself well to CM analysis, the chained algorithm is so named because it requires discretization of the object being modeled into beam elements and analyzes each element in succession". This definition clearly implies that chained algorithms actually introduce the concept of FEM where the summation of relatively smaller deformation of all discretized elements results in a feasible analysis of larger deformation (geometric nonlinearity). Therefore, we can logically consider all chained BCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and chained PRBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> as FEM-related or chained algorithms. They all have been proved to be effective options for model modeling large deflection of slender straight beams and ICBs.</p><p>Although the above mentioned methods have already been successfully applied to different applications in practice, these modeling methods may still have their limitations. We would like to evaluate them from the following aspects: physical theories used; analytical or numerical; accuracy within its scope; deformation range; computational expense; beam shape characterization; practicability for multiple existing engineering scenarios; challenges in statically synthesizing large-deflection compliant mechanisms; feasibility for mechanism optimization.</p><p>1 Physical theories used: FEM: solid mechanics, Euler Bernoulli beam theory, Timoshenko beam theory; Elliptical integral method: Euler Bernoulli beam theory; (chained-)BCM: Euler Bernoulli beam theory; (chained-)TBCM: Timoshenko beam theory; (chained-)PRBM (mostly Euler Bernoulli beam theory). a Euler Bernoulli beam theory: it assumes that the deformation of the beam only comes from bending deflection, and it also does not consider axial elastic elongation or compression. b Timoshenko beam theory: it assumes that the deformation of the beam comes from both bending deflection and the shear strain of every cross-section, and it also does not consider axial elastic elongation or compression. c Solid mechanics: it considers more complex deformation of any deformable body so in the case studied using solid mechanics to analyze beam-deflection problems is supposed to be the most accurate one. This is why solid-mechanics-based FEM has been widely used as a verification method in the academic field of mechanical engineering.</p><p>Remark 1. (Chained-)BCM and (chained-)TBCM both consider the axial elastic stretching by adding an engineering approximation in their governing equations (see Eq. 3.11 and Eq 3.12 in Chapter 3 of Awtar's PhD thesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>) although they are based on Euler Bernoulli beam theory and Timoshenko beam theory.</p><p>2 Analytical or numerical: FEM, (chained) BCM, and chained PRBM are numerical methods whereas elliptical integral method is analytical. One of PRBM's main advantages compared to elliptical integral method or other numerical methods is that it simplifies the nonlinear beam-deflection problem into a very straightforward one that can be solved by closed-form formulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, which helps users to design CMs in early stages (essentially, PRBM tends to serve as an engineering or empirical approximation rather than an exact analytical solution to the beam model). Chained PRBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref>] logically provides better accuracy however at the cost of transforming the closed-form approximation into a numerical one. 3 Accuracy within its scope: Commercial FEM-based software is reliable to trust as most of them have passed the standard modeling tests proposed by International Association Engineering Modeling (NSFEMS), which is why researchers tend to use it as a means of verification <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In CM modeling, a huge portion of designs employ slender beams as the elementary flexible components so any method based on geometrically nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory (it is chosen here since we can ignore shear deformation on the cross section of slender beams) can do the trick. Obviously, elliptical integral method provides the most accurate solution in this case. PRBM loses some accuracy due to its own assumptions made (it is limited in terms of estimating larger end slope of slender beams <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). Besides, BCM can accurately capture intermediate deformation whereas it cannot handle large-deflection scenarios due to its assumptions made. 4 Deformation range: FEM, elliptical integral method, chained BCM, and (chained) PRBM are valid analyzing large deformation whereas BCM is valid for intermediate deformation.</p><p>Remark 2. In particular, nonlinear buckling is a type of large deflection for slender beams. Logically, BCM and TBCM cannot handle nonlinear buckling <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Chained-BCM and chained-TBCM are used to analyze bistable mechanisms (with post-buckling involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>[28]) so is chained-PRBM. There's also work just using PRBM to handle nonlinear buckling but its accuracy is compensated by classic beam theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. </p></div>
<div><head n="1.3.">Main contributions</head><p>Clearly, the existing methods have already proved to be effective in many used cases under some reasonable assumptions related to practices. However, those methods have as well their own application limitations, for example, elliptical integrals cannot handle non-tip-loading cases and BCM requires small vertical deflection, etc. Compared to those existing results, the main contributions of this paper are as follows.</p><p>• Formulation: we formulate the large beam-deflection problem as a nonlinear BVP of an ODE by applying Euler-Bernoulli Beam theory. Note that such a formulation can be used as well to model more general and complex scenarios by considering distributed forces, moments, and so on. However, for the sake of simplicity, this paper focuses only on two commonly-used flexible members in CMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>: straight beams and initially curved beams (ICBs).</p><p>• Numerical methods: we apply several useful numerical methods (including finite difference method, shooting method, weighted residual methods, and so on) to solve the formulated BVPs that describe large beamdeflection problems. We have presented detailed derivations of each method regarding solving the BVPs and provided in-depth discussions about the advantages and differences of these methods. Numerical results are presented accordingly.</p><p>• Proving feasibility in modeling CMs: we have proved the feasibility of the mentioned numerical methods in modeling 2 representative CMs: straight-beam-based cross-axis flexural pivots <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and ICB-based hinges <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. All numerical methods have been used and compared in modeling the 2 CMs with numerical results provided accordingly.</p></div>
<div><head n="2.">Modeling of large deflection via geometrically nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli Beam Theory</head><p>In this paper, all of our proposed methods aim to model large beam-deflection problems via geometrically nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Assuming that, for any point along the beam axis, its corresponding curvature d d is proportional to the exerted moment ( ) at (named as elastic assumption), i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">d d = ( )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where is the elastic modulus and is the second moment of area of the beam's cross-section. If we consider the cross section varies along the beam axis (i.e., the second moment of inertia of the cross section ( ) is a function of ), we will have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= ( ) ( )</formula><p>Note that ( ) is formulated based on the centroidal axis, and it passes through the centroid of the cross section <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Therefore, the cross section varies along the centroidal axis and the beam length is defined along it as well. Besides, the centroidal axis lies in a plane so only planar beams are studied in this paper. If the slender beam has an initial curvature 1 ( ) where we consider the varying curvature by defining 1 ( ) as a function of , we will logically arrive at:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">= ( ) ( ) + 1 ( )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Here, ( ) is defined as the exerted moment at any arbitrary point on the beam, noted as ( , ( ), ( )) due to all external loads on the beam, such as beam-tip loads, distributed loads, distributed moment and pressure along the beam body. In this paper, we only focus on two representative examples: beam-tip loads on constant-cross-section straight beams and constant-cross-section ICBs of constant curvature (i.e., ( ) and ( ) are both constant noted as and in the following) respectively since these two loading scenarios frequently happen in CMs. Therefore, we can derive the corresponding ( ) according to the general beam-tip loading shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">( ) = ( -( )) + ( -( )) +<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where an arbitrary force (which can be decomposed into a vertical force and a horizontal force ) and an arbitrary moment at its beam end ( , ) or equivalently along the beam axis. Obviously, we can also consider many other loading scenarios, such as flexible beams with varying cross-section, varying curvature, pressure and so on, and it is evident that all those common loading cases can be easily formulated like (3) by recalculating its right-hand terms with correct applied moments at .</p><p>Rearranging Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) and Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>), we will end up with:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d d = ( -( )) + ( -( )) + +<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Then, conducting differentiation on Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>) with respect to results in the following ODE: </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">d 2 d 2 = - (cos ( ) + sin ( ))<label>(5)</label></formula><p>As stated above, we will focus on the following two cases since they commonly-used in the design process of CMs as standards parts:</p><p>Case 1: Straight beams:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">1 = 0;</formula><p>Case 2: Circular beams (constant-curvature beams): 1 = ( is an arbitrary constant real number).</p><p>For these two cases, different numerical methods will be detailed in Section 5 to solve large beam deflection problems, based on which two CMs (straight-beam-involved one and circular-beam-involved one) will be analyzed in Section 6. Remark 3. Note that there is a special type of beam-deflection scenarios called nonlinear buckling where the studied beam is only subjected to an axial force shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Its governing equation can be rearranged from BVP (6) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">D.E. d 2 d 2 = - (cos ( ) + sin ( )) = - sin ( ) B.C. (0) = 0 d d ( ) = + 1 = 0<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where = 0, = 0 and 1 = 0. Physically speaking, if reaches the buckling limit, the straight slender beam will experience nonlinear buckling, possibly resulting in 3 different (deformed) beam shapes shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</p><p>Mathematically speaking, it is normal that BVPs may have multiple solutions given some specific conditions. Normally, in applied mathematics, the concept of bifurcation theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> needs to be introduced to solve these BVPs where some techniques are used, such as adjusting initial guesses, determining the boundary conditions by making most of the information of the governing equation, perturbation method and so on. This topic is out of the scope of this paper. However, a comprehensive solution to handle nonlinear buckling problems of slender beams numerically has been recently proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.">Recall of some useful numerical methods</head><p>In this paper, we will adopt different numerical methods which are necessary to solve beam-deflection problems via geometrically nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, the majority of which are based on Weierstrass's first theorem and Newton-Raphson method. Runge-Kutta method and Euler method are also involved in this paper. Therefore, we first proceed with a quick theory recap on them hereafter for a better demonstration of the rest of the paper.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.1.">Numerical method to approximate continuous function</head><p>Recall that this paper aims to find a continuous solution of the geometrically nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, but its exact analytical solution is very hard to find. Therefore, we bypass the difficult task to approximate the exact analytical solution using polynomials as basis functions, which is based on the employment of Weierstrass's first theorem. This theorem implies that, instead of finding the exact solution to BVP (6), we can find some specific polynomials that can quite accurately approximate the exact solution.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.2.">Numerical method to solve algebraic equation</head><p>There are several methods to handle nonlinear equations or systems of equations reported in the literature. In this paper, we would like to proceed with a commonly used method called Newton-Raphson method for these problems. Here, a brief recap is presented to solve a general nonlinear equation ( ) = 0 ∈ ℝ ×1 with ∈ ℝ ×1 ( ≥ ), which can be realized by the following iterative equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">= -1 - ( ) -1 | = -1 ( -1 )</formula><p>where represents the th iterative solution with 0 being a given initial guess value. After the convergence (in practice the convergence criteria is set as || +1 -|| ≤ where is a pre-defined threshold), we can finally obtain the solution to ( ) = 0. The dimension of the Jacobian matrix ( ) is ℝ × . Obviously, the major computation of this algorithm lies in calculating the pseudo inverse ( &gt; ) or the inverse ( = ) of ( ) <ref type="bibr">[42][43]</ref>. Therefore, the higher values of and of the studied matrix, which leads to higher dimension of the matrix, would result in more computational time for computing the pseudo inverse or the inverse of this matrix.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.3.">Numerical methods to approximate ODE with known initial conditions</head><p>Given a general nonlinear ODE</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">d d = ( , )</formula><p>for ∈ [ 0 , ] with known initial condition ( 0 ) = 0 . It is difficult or impossible to find out its analytical solution if ( , ) is highly nonlinear. Numerical methods are then needed to be used to approximate its solution. Euler method and Runge-Kutta method are two commonly used ones, which will be recalled hereafter. Consider = ( ) is the solution to the above ODE with ( 0 ) = 0 where 0 being the known initial condition.</p><p>Euler's method: Denote ℎ as the fixed sampling step of the space [ 0 , ] for , i.e., +1 = + ℎ , and then we proceed with +1 = + ( , )ℎ for 0 ≤ ≤ -1. Finally, we will end up with ( +1 ) ≈ +1 .</p><p>Runge-Kutta method: Similarly, Runge-Kutta method is also a popular choice for numerically solving ODE with known initial conditions. The formula of the fourth Runge-Kutta method is presented below. Similarly, ℎ is defined as the step size. Then, we proceed with the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">1 = ℎ ( , ), 2 = ℎ ( + ℎ 2 , + 1 2 ), 3 = ℎ ( + ℎ 2 , + 2 2 ), 4 = ℎ ( + ℎ , + 3 ) +1 = + 1 6 ( 1 + 2 2 + 2 3 + 4 )</formula><p>which computes the approximate solution as ( +1 ) ≈ +1 .</p></div>
<div><head n="4.">Applying different numerical methods to solving beam deflection problems</head><p>In this section, numerical methods are explained in terms of solving geometrically nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, and the detailed derivation is presented accordingly, where numerical methods presented in Section 3 will be applied. Note that apart from Non-iterative IVP method (NIM) stated in Section 4.3, the other methods can directly deal with inflection points. After having the numerical solution of BVP (6), i.e. Θ( ), we can then characterize the deformed beam shape via:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">( ) = ∫ 0 cos(Θ( ))d ; ( ) = ∫ 0 sin(Θ( ))d ;<label>(8)</label></formula><p>for ∈ [0, ] with being the length of the deformed beam.</p></div>

Clearly, there are altogether equations available and unknowns to be solved. Then, we can numerically handle ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">9</ref>), which contains -1 equations, using Newton-Raphson method presented in Section 3 to obtain the values of Θ for 0 ≤ ≤ -1, equivalently the approximation Θ( ) of the solution ( ) to BVP <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Besides, we take one step further to add an iterative strategy for automatically choosing the number of sampling points : if |Θ ( ) -Θ -1 ( )| ≤ where is the th option ( = 1, 2, 3...) for and Θ ( ) is the approximation under sampling points, then is settled: = ; if not, = +1 = + 1. This strategy enables the method adaptive to solve the studied system (9) without manually setting up .</p></div>

However, these methods can be all implemented in a local manner for higher accuracy and approximating complex solutions of more BVPs, such as BVPs' solutions of highly frequent vibration (where in the case of beam-deflection problems, it refers to high-order buckling phenomena). Unlike the procedure explained in Section 4.4.1 to Section 4.4.6 from a global perspective, the following explains how BVP ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) is handled using one of the mentioned weighted residual methods, i.e. collocation method in a local manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p><p>Generally speaking, by dividing the interval [0, ] into + 1 points 0 = 0 &lt; 1 &lt; ⋯ &lt; = , collocation method approximates the solution of the above BVP via linear combination of well-chosen basis functions by satisfying D.E. and B.C. at all collocation points. Precisely, denote by Θ( ) the approximate solution of BVP <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, and suppose that a cubic polynomial ( ) is chosen to approximate the solution of BVP <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_41">on each sub-interval [ -1 , ], i.e., Θ( ) = ∑ =1 ( )<label>where</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_42">( ) = ∑ 3 =0 , ∀ ∈ -1 , 0, otherwise<label>(34)</label></formula><p>with for 0 ≤ ≤ 3 being the 4 unknown polynomial coefficients on the th interval. In total, we have 4 unknown parameters to be identified. Clearly, Θ( ) should satisfy the D.E. in BVP ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>) for all collocations points, and this yields the following 3 algebraic equations to be fulfilled:</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">d 2 Θ d 2 ( -1 ) + (cos Θ( -1 ) + sin( -1 )) = d 2 ( ∑ 3 =0 ) d 2 ( -1 ) + (cos( 3 ∑ =0 -1 ) + sin( 3 ∑ =0 -1 )) = 0 d 2 Θ d 2 ( ̄ -1 ) + (cos Θ( ̄ -1 ) + sin( ̄ -1 )) = d 2 ( ∑ 3 =0 ) d 2 ( ̄ -1 ) + (cos( 3 ∑ =0 ( ̄ -1 ) ) + sin( 3 ∑ =0 ( ̄ -1 ) )) = 0 d 2 Θ d 2 ( ) + (cos Θ( ) + sin( )) = d 2 ( ∑ 3 =0 ) d 2 ( ) + (cos( 3 ∑ =0 ) + sin( 3 ∑ =0 )) = 0<label>(35)</label></formula><p>where ̄ -1 = -1 + 2 . Note that the approximated solution Θ( ) is a combination of a series of local cubic polynomials, therefore additional equation should be imposed to guarantee the continuity at all collocation points, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">-1 ( -1 ) = ( -1 ), ∀ ∈ [2, ]<label>(36)</label></formula><p>Hence we have the above -1 algebraic equations due to the continuity conditions. Together with the 2-dimensional B.C. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, we finally obtain a set of algebraic equations with dimension 3 + -1 + 2 = 4 + 1, which will be used to compute those 4 unknowns parameter defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. So far, we have demonstrated the collocation method performed in a local manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. In common weighted residual methods (see Section 4.4.1 to Section 4.4.6), they are all implemented in a global manner, which means a single global polynomial Θ( ) ∈ 1 is used to approximate the solution of (6). However, the solution of the locallyperformed collocation method only ensures the continuity of Θ( ), equivalently Θ( ) ∈ 0 , which ends up with non-differentiable piecewise polylines for the solution Θ( ). Apparently, this non-differentiability of Θ( ) contradicts the nature of beam deflection since ( ) is always continuous and differentiable, equivalently ( ) ∈ 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. To treat such a problem, we take one step further to modify the collocation method via ensuring the differentiability of Θ( ), i.e., Θ( ) ∈ 0 . By imposing the following derivative continuity conditions at all collocation points:</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">d -1 d ( -1 ) = d d ( -1 ), ∀ ∈ [2, ]<label>(37)</label></formula><p>This extra added constraints of derivative continuity leads to a differentiable global approximation of the solution of the studied BVP <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, bypassing the need of conducting curve fitting process afterwards. It is clear that (37) yields another -1 equations, ending up with altogether 4 + 1 + -1 = 5 algebraic equations available. In summary, the collocation method enables us to solve the 4 unknowns based on the 4 + 1 equations from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_43">35</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_44">36</ref>), or 5 equations from ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">6</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref> which can be numerically solved via Newton-Raphson method presented in Section 3.</p></div>

<div><head n="5.4.">Summary for the presented methods</head><p>In this section, we aim to summarize modeling beam-deflection problems using the 10 presented methods in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and feasibility respectively.</p><p>1. Efficiency: Compared to FEM using 1-D beam elements, all the 10 methods present better efficiency in modeling beam-deflection problems. Among these 10 methods, FDM is the most time-consuming one due to its modeling nature. It essentially transforms the BVP into a very high-dimensional system of equations compared to weighted residual methods, which results in more computational expense. 2. Accuracy: All the presented 10 methods have been proved reliable in modeling beam-deflection problems by FEM. In particular, collocation methods will lose some accuracy if the number and the property of pre-set polynomials are not properly chosen, which is explicitly reflected in the results of CMG and CML (see 4 &amp; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">14</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">10</ref> &amp; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_24">20</ref>). However, the above mentioned is all about numerical errors, and we always have means to reduce them. For example, we can always increase the order of the pre-set polynomials defined in all weighted residual methods and decrease the predefined threshold of Newton Raphson method to reduce numerical errors. In terms of the used constitutive model, we here take one step further to analyze the accuracy compared to actual beam deflection in reality. As we have stated, all the presented methods are based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory (Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>)) where some assumptions are made. This constitutive model ignores the shear deformation on cross sections of the beam and assumes that the studied beam is inextensible. To handle the above 2 mentioned problems, Timoshenko beam theory needs to be used to consider the shear deformation of beam cross sections, and Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) also needs to be modified to consider the axial extension or compression. 3. Feasibility: As stated before, NIM can not handle beam-deflection problems where inflection points are involved, and LSM often suffers from falling into local minimal solving relatively complex and large beamdeflection problems, such as circular beams. Apart from NIM and LSM, the rest proposed 8 methods present full feasibility in terms of solving large beam-deflection problems.</p></div>
<div><head n="6.">Mechanism synthesis via the 10 proposed methods</head><p>In this section, we aim to model 2 representative compliant mechanisms to prove the feasibility of the proposed 10 methods: straight-beam-based cross-axis compliant revolute joint <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">25</ref>) and circular-beam-based compliant revolute joint (see Fig. <ref type="figure">36</ref>). To synthesize the 2 mentioned compliant mechanisms, we have to follow the 3 modeling principles of mechanics <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> The above 3 relationships determine the essence of modeling deformable bodies regardless of their linear or nonlinear properties. Essentially, we need to solve a nonlinear system of equations that are composed of the above three types of relationships. Therefore, we have two strategies to implement the programming process. The first one is packing the constitutive equations into a function, and calling the function in the iterative process of Newton-Raphson method. This strategy turns out to be straightforward in programming but strongly complex in calculation. The second strategy is directly coding the constitutive equations in the entire nonlinear system of equations and solving it using Newton-Raphson method. The latter has been proved a little more complex in coding but more efficient in computation. Finally, the modeling results are compared and verified by FEM results (where solid mesh elements are used) with corresponding errors presented accordingly.</p></div>
<div><head n="6.1.">Straight-beam-based cross-axis compliant revolute joint</head><p>In this section, a straight-beam-based cross-axis compliant revolute joint is modeled where the presented 10 methods are used to handle the constitutive beam model (Euler-Bernoulli beam theory) one by one. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">25</ref>, the revolute joint is composed of two slender straight beams (beam #1 and beam #2) and a rigid link. Each of the are the coordinates of A, A * , B, B * , K and K * . Then, we can numerically solve Eq. ( <ref type="formula">38</ref>) to (41) using Newton-Raphson method. Besides, Δ Δ Φ refers to the translational and rotational displacements of K, the reference point of the modeled revolute mechanism. Particularly, the 10 proposed methods in Section 4 are used respectively to handle the constitutive equations ( <ref type="formula">38</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>, therefore ending up with 10 final modeling results to be compared and analyzed in the next section.</p></div>
<div><head n="6.1.2.">Numerical results</head><p>Modeling the studied revolute mechanism is all about finding out the relationships between applied loads and the corresponding displacements Δ Δ Φ both at the reference point K. The material properties and geometry information are provided in the following: The results of and Δ Δ Φ are provided via using the 10 proposed methods in Section 4 respectively, followed by FEM verification (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">26</ref> to Fig. <ref type="figure">35</ref>). Obviously, every method proposed in Section 4 presents high accuracy compared to solid-mechanics-based FEM with errors all below 0.5%. In all these numerical methods, the next-step initial guess is set up as the last-step answer for faster convergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Particularly, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">28b</ref>, no inflection points exist in the 2 deformed beams of the compliant revolute joint so NIM can still work in this case. The graphical results by FEM are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">37a</ref> where the fabricated and the 10 -deformed mechanism are presented respectively.</p></div>
<div><head n="6.2.">Circular-beam-based compliant revolute joint</head><p>In this section, a circular-beam-based compliant revolute joint is studied where the presented 10 methods are used to handle the constitutive beam model (Euler-Bernoulli beam theory) accordingly. The revolute joint is composed of two slender circular beams (beam #1 and beam #2) and a rigid link shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">36</ref>. Each of the beams is fixed at one end respectively (O 1 and O 2 ) and rigidly attached to a rigid link AB on the other end. Similarly, , , and ℎ refer to the length, radius, width, and thickness of the 2 involved elementary beams respectively. The global coordinate frame X-O-Y is established at the mid-point of O 1 and O 2 . A combined load composed of , and is applied at the reference point K (the mid-point of AB), resulting in a deformed shape of the studied revolute mechanism shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">36</ref>.</p><p>, and are the forces and moment exerted at the tip A of beam #1 by the rigid link. , and are the forces and moment exerted at the tip B of beam #2 by the rigid link. Besides, A * , B * and K * refer to the points after deformation accordingly. Φ is the rotational angle of the revolute joint. 2 local coordinate systems are set up for each flexible beam (see X 1 -O 1 -Y 1 and X 2 -O 2 -Y 2 in Fig. <ref type="figure">36</ref>). Note that we assume O 1 O 2 =AB = for this revolute joint.</p><p>, and are the coordinates of A, A * , B, B * , K and K * . Then, we can numerically solve Eq. ( <ref type="formula">42</ref>) to (45) using Newton-Raphson method. Besides, Δ Δ Φ refers to the translational and rotational displacements of K, the reference point of the modeled revolute mechanism. In particular, 9 out of the 10 proposed methods (except NIM) in Section 4 are used respectively to handle the constitutive equations ( <ref type="formula">42</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">43</ref>), therefore ending up with 9 final modeling results to be compared and analyzed in the next section as well. In Section 5.3.3, we have found out that it's easy to generate inflection points in deformation of circular beams. Therefore, we don't use NIM to solve the constitutive equations (42)(43) of the slender circular beams.</p></div>

It is noticed that all methods used present high accuracy compared to solid-mechanics-based FEM with maximum errors around 2%. Likewise, in all these numerical methods, the next-step initial guess is set up as the last-step answer for faster convergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The graphical results by FEM are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">37b</ref> where the fabricated and the 10 -deformed mechanism are presented respectively. </p></div>
<div><head n="6.3.">Error analysis</head><p>This section aims to analyze the origin of errors when using the proposed 10 methods. According to Figs. 26 to 35, the errors are all below 0.5% using the proposed 10 methods to solve straight-beam-deflection problems. The maximum errors in terms of modeling circular-beam-based revolute joints are around 2%. It's obvious to conclude that all these used methods have proved to be effective modeling CMs. However, we still need to analyze where these errors are generated and how we can reduce them. To start with, the reason why we use solid-mechanics-based FEM as the reference method is that it considers all sorts of deformation in any deformable object.</p></div>
<div><head n="6.3.1.">Numerical errors</head><p>The first type of errors is called numerical errors, which comes from the essence of numerical methods. The aim of numerical methods is to approximate the solution to the studied mathematical models so they would inevitably lead to some numerical errors. However, we have many ways to decrease these errors. For instance, we can increase the order of the pre-set polynomials defined in all weighted residual methods; we can decrease the predefined threshold of Newton Raphson method's convergence criteria in all weighted residual methods, NIM, SH, and NIM.</p></div>
<div><head n="6.3.2.">Model errors</head><p>As long as the numerical errors have been decreased to their minimal, what is left is the model errors due to the non-perfect constitutive model. In our paper, Euler Bernoulli beam theory (Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)) is adopted which is based on some assumptions: ignoring the shear deformation on cross sections of the beam and assuming that the studied beam is inextensible. Logically, model errors always exist compared to solid-mechanics-based FEM since it takes care of all sorts of deformation in any deformable object. To solve the above 2 mentioned problems, our future work will focus on Timoshenko beam theory which includes the shear deformation of beam cross sections, and Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) also needs to be modified to consider the axial extension or compression.</p></div>
<div><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>Compliant mechanisms have been serving as a promising option in designing mechanical systems. The constitutive equations of the elementary flexible members, such as slender straight beams and slender circular beams are studied in this paper. The planar beam-deflection problems are formulated as BVPs of corresponding ODEs using the most classic Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Then, the 10 proposed numerical methods are used respectively to solve planar large deflection of slender straight beams and slender circular beams with promising results and detailed analysis provided. These methods have also been proved to be effective in terms of synthesizing CMs where 2 representative compliant revolute joints are modeled. Our future work will focus on modeling spatial deflection of slender beams for studying spatial CMs.</p></div>
