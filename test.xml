<div><head>Identification and validation of an allele-specific marker (ASM) for the DREB2 locus</head><p>A core set of 45 foxtail millet accessions were screened for their dehydration tolerance on the basis of LP and RWC (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). All the accessions were subjected to 24 h of dehydration stress as compared with the respective controls. The amplified genomic DNA sequence (SiDREB2 FL_F and SiDREB2 FL_R primers) analysis of SiDREB2 from four highly dehydration-tolerant (GS-464, IC-403579, Prasad, and IC-403476) and four highly sensitive (IC-403521, IC-404178, Lepakshi, and IC-480117) accessions revealed the synonymous SNP at base pair 558 (A/G transition) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>). This A/G transition was further validated by sequencing of the SiDREB2 gene with the same primers in an additional 11 and 26 dehydration-tolerant and sensitive accessions, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Based on this sequence analysis, locus-specific primers (LSPs) and allele-specific primers (ASPs) were developed (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). PCR products of LSPs (SiDREB2 FL_F and SNP.TS_R) and ASPs (DREB.AP2_F and SNP.Tol_R) in all 45 accessions were generated at the same time and checked by resolving them on a 1% agarose gel independently. Later, the PCR products were mixed and resolved on an agarose gel for both locus-specific markers and ASMs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5B</ref>). LSPs gave a 558 bp fragment in all the accessions, while ASPs gave a 261 bp fragment in 15 dehydration-tolerant accessions only. Therefore, the dehydration-tolerant accessions were proven to be linked to the 'A'-specific allele (Table1).</p><p>The importance of allele-specific PCR systems for reliable SNP typing has been demonstrated several times in previous studies <ref>(Wu et al., 1989;</ref><ref>Wei et al., 2006)</ref>. Introduction of additional mismatch bases has improved the specificity of this technique <ref>(Drenkard et al., 2000)</ref>. Its application is especially important for an accurate discrimination of different alleles in MAS. In the present study, only one pair of ASPs was used to amplify the specific products from the dehydration-tolerant and sensitive accessions. Therefore, the ASM can be effectively used to type SNPs as well as to avoid unambiguous false scoring. The functional differences in trait performance mainly caused by SNPs has also been reported in previous studies on several cloned genes <software>MAS</software> MAS. In the present study, only one pair of ASPs was used to amplify the specific products from the dehydration-tolerant and sensitive accessions. Therefore, the ASM can be effectively used to type SNPs as well as to avoid unambiguous false scoring. The functional differences in trait performance mainly caused by SNPs has also been reported in previous studies on several cloned genes MAS efficiency is influenced by several complex factors such as recombination between the marker and the candidate gene, a low level of polymorphism between the parents with contrasting traits, and lower resolution of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) due to environmental interactions. In the present study, the ASM is part of the candidate gene, thus eliminating the main disadvantage of <software>MAS</software>. However, the ASM developed in this study is a dominant marker, and therefore it cannot distinguish the heterozygotes. The marker has high reliability and efficiency, and the desired PCR product can be identified easily on a simple agarose gel. With the help of this marker, dehydration-tolerant accessions can be selected at a variety of life stages. This is particularly true when the target is the dehydration-tolerant allele in backcross breeding and thus the foxtail millet breeding process can be accelerated. Further, the ASM identified would facilitate allele mining of foxtail millet germplasm resources, thereby leading to identification and utilization of newer alleles in crop improvement<ref>(Peng et al., 1999;</ref><ref>Takahashi et al., 2001;</ref><ref>Liu et al., 2002;</ref><ref>Jin et al., 2003;</ref><ref>Toshiyuki et al., 2003;</ref><ref>Kim et al., 2005;</ref><ref>Garce Â´s-Claver et al., 2007;</ref><ref>Fan et al., 2009)</ref>. Molecular markerassisted breeding technology is a rapid and accurate method for any candidate gene, providing a very effective tool for backcross breeding <ref>(Collard and Mackill, 2008)</ref> (Collard and Mackill, 2008). </p></div>
